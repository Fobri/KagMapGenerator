# KagMapGenerator
A simple program to generate maps for King Arthur's Gold.

There is a windows build included, you can just download that if you dont feel like building it from source.

## Map
Created from sampling multiple noise functions at different frequencies and sine waves.

If there are no suitable places for tents and flags they will simply not get generated at all.

## Bases
Generated from predefined 7x4 'rooms' which are connected by a wave function collapse algorithm.
